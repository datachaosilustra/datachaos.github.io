**TidyTuesday** is a weekly data visualization challenge that I use as a creative and learning space. Each week, a new dataset is posted in the [tidytuesday project's github](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), which is organized by the [Data Science Learning Community](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main), and participants are invited to explore and visualize the data using R.
